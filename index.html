    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am presently engaged in my PhD at INRAE, with a research focus on the process-oriented modeling of ammonia emissions originating from grazed pastures. The core of my study involves the integration of dynamic interactions among soil, vegetation, livestock, and atmospheric elements to enhance the precision of NH3 flux estimations. This task includes the modification of the Generation of Ammonia from Grazing (GAG) model, initially developed for UK conditions, to better align with intensively grazed grasslands in the Northwestern region of France.</p>
    <p>The primary objective of my work is to address deficiencies in existing models by integrating real-time data to ensure that the models accurately portray genuine ecological dynamics and have the capability to forecast NH3 releases across various climatic and managerial scenarios. My academic pursuits revolve around the convergence of atmospheric science and agricultural methodologies, with a specific emphasis on the impacts of sustainable farming practices on air quality and the exchange of trace gases.</p>
